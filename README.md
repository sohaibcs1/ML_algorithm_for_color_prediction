# ML_algorithm_for_color_prediction

Project Requirements:
1: Understanding Color Mixing and LAB Space: Analyze the provided table of color mixes, where each mix is represented by percentages of white, yellow, red, and black. Understand how variations in these proportions affect the L*, a*, and b* values in the LAB color space.

2: Develop Method or System of Equations: Devise a method or system of equations to correlate the base color proportions (white, yellow, red, black) with the desired color's L*, a*, and b* values. This system should allow for the determination of the exact proportions (%) of each base color required to recreate the specific color.

3: Consider LAB Color Space Properties: Take into account the properties of the LAB color space, where L* represents brightness, a* represents the green to red axis, and b* represents the blue to yellow axis. Ensure that the method considers how changes in color proportions affect these values.

4: Clear and Concise Formulation: Present a clear and concise formulation of the approach to solving the problem. Explain how the system of equations or method works to determine the necessary proportions (%) of each base color to achieve the provided L*, a*, and b* values.

By meeting these requirements, the objective is to provide a solution to the color mixing problem that demonstrates understanding of colorimetry, algebraic principles, and the LAB color space, using real data and practical concepts of color representation.
